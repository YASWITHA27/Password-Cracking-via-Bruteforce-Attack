# Password-Cracking-via-Bruteforce-Attack
Executed and analyzed dictionary and brute-force password cracking methods using Cain Abel on a Windows XP virtual machine. Evaluated the effectiveness of various password complexities and demonstrated the impact of password length and character set on cracking time. It emphasized the importance of strong, complex passwords for improved security.

Executed and thoroughly analyzed dictionary and brute-force password cracking techniques using Cain & Abel on a Windows XP virtual machine to understand vulnerabilities in password security. Demonstrated how dictionary attacks exploit common or weak passwords from precompiled lists, while brute-force attacks systematically attempt every possible combination. Evaluated the effectiveness of password complexity by testing various password lengths, character sets (letters, numbers, symbols), and patterns to determine their impact on cracking time. Documented how simple, short passwords were compromised quickly, while longer, complex passwords significantly increased resistance to attacks.

Highlighted findings emphasized the critical role of strong password policies, including the use of randomized characters and extended lengths, in mitigating unauthorized access. Provided actionable recommendations for adopting multi-factor authentication and password management practices to enhance security. This analysis served as a practical demonstration of real-world attack methods and the need for robust cybersecurity practices in both personal and enterprise environments.
